# Packaging
 Assuming you have Fyne setup, it's very easy to build.
 First, clone the repo
 `git clone (https://github.com/craftnut/fyne-sysinfo.git)`
 Then, run the build script
 `package-win.bat` on Windows,
 `package-linux.sh` on Linux

 This is not tested to work on Mac, therefore there is no build script for Mac, you're own your own there.
 Same goes for Android.
